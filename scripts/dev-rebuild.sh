#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Rebuild the entire local AFT dev stack and stage it so a host restart
# (OpenCode, Pi, etc.) picks up the latest local changes without going
# through a release.
#
# What this does:
#   1. Reads the workspace version from crates/aft/Cargo.toml
#   2. Builds the Rust release binary
#   3. Builds the aft-bridge, opencode-plugin, and pi-plugin dists
#   4. Copies the release binary into the versioned cache that hosts
#      resolve via @cortexkit/aft-bridge (~/.cache/aft/bin/v<version>/aft)
#   5. Ad-hoc-signs the binary on macOS so Gatekeeper does not kill it
#   6. Prints a summary + restart hint
#
# Idempotent. Safe to run repeatedly. Pass --skip-rust to skip the cargo
# build when you only want to refresh plugin dists.
